<b> anti-genocide </b>

A game about committing genocide to stop the genocide of your peoples

# Story (why)

A species has been given a divine mandate to purge the universe of all unclean things. As they expore the system with probes and one maned vehicles you meet a new race of being whos cutoms are so barbaric that it takes their people back to the purges of almost a century ago. When they learn of this new race an outcry is spread claiming that they must purge these barbarians. So they begin making a genetic virus that only targes the impures of this race with a delivery system fast enough that a cure can't be found. . . At least, that is what our spies have discovered, and now we have created a fleet to protect our species before the virus is complete.  
  
As your fleets near the enymy planet you discover that they too have been building a fleet. But this fleet has been built to the same specifications as yours, because their spies stole the designs.  
  
Now we are preparing to go to war and have devised military simulations of increasing difficulty to train our generals and pilots to be prepared for any events. Should you faile, you will be terminated and replaced with a more competant soldier.
